<td>French agony in Indochina was even longer. After 1949, Ho Chi Minh’s insurgent troops counted on the support of the powerful People’s Republic of China. After his rise to absolute power in 1949 Mao Zedong became one of the most feared enemies of Western Europe and the rest of the Western world.<br />The birth of communist China also demonstrated that communism would not only triumph in industrial nations, as Marx had predicted, but also in agrarian ones. Mao, who set himself the aim of recovering China’s power, was not only a determined advocate of decolonization but would also offer to help any peasant movement that revolted against colonization or bourgeois interests. His first opportunity to do it was in neighboring Indochina.</td>

<td>The fact that China, the most populous country and a great civilization, became communist gave this ideology formidable clout. But this ideology had also been in crisis since the death of Mao Zedong, and faced serious threats to survive. In the 1980s China began experimenting with a partial introduction of the market economy in order to avoid the system’s collapse, but discontent continued spreading, particularly among the urban generations that demanded democratic reforms and less repression. This led to the Tiananmen Square protests in summer 1989, in which several hundred people were killed by police forces.Unlike the USSR and its European satellites, the Chinese government did not hesitate to use all forms of repression to ensure the survival of the regime. On the other hand China learned from the collapse of the Soviet Union and speeded up a process of economic transformation into what was called a socialist market economy. In this way capitalism was to return to China, but under the control of the state and the supervision of the Communist Party.</td>

<td>On the other hand its legacy regarding liberty and human rights was disastrous. Terror was the inseparable companion of the Soviet state throughout its seven decades of existence, reaching unbearable levels during the time of Stalin. As a result of the famous book The Gulag Archipelago, by the dissident writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the world could find out about the reality of the forced labor camps where so many of the convicts faced a tragic end. After the fall of the Soviet Union, it became known that the work of the prisoners in the Gulag generated around a ten percent of Soviet production. A regime that claimed to stand against all sorts of slavery ended up benefitting from slave labor.<br/>The data about the victims of terror and repression in the Soviet Union from 1917 varies a lot. According to the Black Book of Communism, published by several academics in 1997, the number of deaths could reach a minimum of twenty million.<br/>As communism spread around the world similar methods of violent repression were used, although some leaders applied them with more rigor. This was particularly the case of the founding father of the People’s Republic of China, Mao Zedong, who learned from the Soviet Union that violence on a grand scale was necessary in order to consolidate a communist regime. Around sixty-five million Chinese people died from repression in Communist China according to the Black Book. In Cambodia, the number of deaths caused by Pol Pot’s regime was around two million people, which constituted twenty percent of the population. Vietnam was responsible for about one million deaths and North Korea around two million. As regards the Marxist regimes in Africa, its victims were around 1,700,000 deaths; and in Latin America, 150,000.<br/>Communism, a movement that aimed at setting human beings free from all forms of injustice caused the death of over ninety million people in the twentieth century. Communist expansion ended up being more lethal than any other imperial movement with which it can be compared, including European colonialism. There is no reliable data that allows us to have an accurate figure for the number of deaths caused by European colonial expansion from the fifteenth century. It is evident that the victims of crimes, executions, and forced labor, as well as slavery and genocide associated with colonialism, would reach several million and affect a wide range of peoples throughout the world. But no colonial regime developed such systematic, repressive structures, nor did it manage to eliminate so many people within such a short time span.</td>

<td>This is one of the reasons why the communist revolution initially only succeeded in Russia, which is a Eurasian country, and the attempt to expand it to Central and Eastern Europe ultimately failed. For let us not forget that the collapse of communism was caused by the 1989 revolutions in Europe.</td>
<td>正因如此，共产主义革命最初只能在俄国取得成功，在中欧和东欧最后都失败了。</td>

<td>The negotiations for Hong Kong’s change of sovereignty were very complex, as they implied ceding sovereignty of a territory governed by the market economy to a communist power. This was one of the reasons why so many citizens from the colony wished to emigrate. The only great concession that the British government obtained from the Chinese was that the city would enjoy an autonomous status for fifty years, and it would continue to be governed by the market economy. In spite of all, one of the great mass migrations provoked by decolonization was the one that took place in Hong Kong. Over one million people emigrated between 1985 and 1997 at the prospect of the change of sovereignty. The exodus continued after 1999.</td>
